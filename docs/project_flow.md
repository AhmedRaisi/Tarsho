#Tarsho Project Workflow - GitHub Flow
##Introduction
This document outlines our team's workflow based on GitHub Flow, a straightforward branching strategy that supports teams and projects that deploy regularly. It's ideal for our collaborative environment, ensuring that we can iterate quickly and efficiently.

##Workflow Steps
###1. Create a Branch
From the main branch, create a new branch for each piece of work. This could be a new feature, a bug fix, or any other task. Branch names should be descriptive.

Command:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

###2. Add Commits
Make changes on your branch and commit them. Make sure your commit messages are meaningful.

Commands:

git add .
git commit -m "[commit message]"

###3. Open a Pull Request (PR)
When your branch is ready to be merged, open a PR. PRs are a way to propose your changes and discuss them.

Command:

git push origin [name_of_your_branch]
Then, open a PR through the GitHub website.

###4. Discuss and Review Your Code
Once a PR is opened, team members can review and discuss the changes. This is an opportunity for feedback and potential improvements.

###5. Merge to main
After your PR is approved, you can merge your branch into main.

Commands:

git checkout main
git merge [name_of_your_branch]
git push origin main

###6. Deploy
With the changes now in main, they are ready to be deployed to production.

###7. Keep Your Branch Updated
Regularly update your branch with the latest changes from main.

Commands:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout [your_branch]
git merge main


##Best Practices
###Branch Naming: Use a consistent naming convention for branches, e.g., feature/, bugfix/, followed by a brief description.
Commits: Keep your commits small and focused; it makes them easier to review and understand.
###PR Descriptions: Write detailed PR descriptions. It should explain what the PR is for and any important details reviewers should know.
###Code Reviews: Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback.
###Testing: Test your changes thoroughly before opening a PR.

##Conclusion
GitHub Flow is a simple yet powerful workflow that helps our team work together efficiently. It is built around the regular and frequent deployment of our code to production. By following these guidelines, we can ensure a smooth and productive development process for the Tarsho project.
